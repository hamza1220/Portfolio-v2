<h3 style="color:#ff5257;"> Cheat or being cheated? </h3>

Fitness trackers are becoming increasingly popular - they aim to make people
healthier by providing them visualized insights for their “body data.” The goal is to
make the users more active and healthier - however, it is not as simple. People have
different motivations to use tracking apps and devices. Ranging from lower
insurance costs and external rewards to wanting a better outlook on social media,
people’s motivations are diverse and constantly fluctuate when using these apps.
These result in “fake outs” - essentially, users cheating the system to achieve the
above goals. My group therefore was tasked with altering the users’ mental models about what is beneficial
for their health and to try to reward behavior helpful for their health rather than the
“fake outs.”

<h2 style="font-size: 24px"> Problems </h2>

<h3 style="color:#ff5257;"> It’s hard to stay motivated. </h3>

A common occurrence for users of fitness applications is to stop using them over
time because of an intrinsic lack of motivation to work out. Due to this lack of
motivation and desire to stay fit, there is an increased probability of users quitting
the application and possibly faking out to achieve rewardspresent in the
application. Therefore, we increase motivation (through personalization) and
reduce rewards to keep the users engaged.

To achieve this goal, we first understood what extrinsic motivation looks like for
users and how to drive that extrinsic motivation through an application. Motivation
can be increased through a plethora of tools such as personalization, accessibility,
ease of use, reliability, rewards, and others. However, delineating every aspect of
motivation is not feasible given the nature of the study. Therefore, our project
emphasizes impacting motivation through personalization and rewards.

However, increasing personalization is a slippery slope, one that leads to the
Personalization Paradox.
To tackle this paradox while increasing motivation through personalization is a
goal that we set out to achieve through this study.

<h3 style="color:#ff5257;"> Narrowing the problem. </h2>

We identified some gaps and consequently brainstormed questions (Appendix 1.1)
that we felt we needed to answer. This led to researching several findings on how
people use and experience fitness tracking.
First, we found out how most current fitness tracking apps target college-going
students [10]. Among this demographic, several students are unable to maintain
healthy fitness habits using digital means because of conflicts with the workload,
education, and schedule [12,13].
And hence, our target demographic of college-going, non-Athletes, irregularly
working out individuals came into being.
We also decided that we need a solution that targets motivation - our research
suggested that the goals of our selected demographic seemed to be shaky.
Motivation in the form of extrinsic rewards or those that target instant
gratification drive focuses away from what the actual goal is - to be healthier.
Altering this drive for the right motivation is what we attempt to solve.

<h2 style="font-size: 24px"> Constraits </h2>

<h3 style="color:#ff5257;"> The motivation-reward loop. </h3>

There were a few constraints that we had to deal with - we’ll try our best to put it in
words.
So the loop starts with either a lack of motivation or misplaced motivation.
Instead of being motivated to be healthier and develop beneficial habits, users are
motivated by high extrinsic rewards that are not aligned with the overarching goal of the fitness app. These extrinsic rewards primarily lead to the users faking out
and using other means to achieve the set goals, targets, instant gratification and fit
into the toxic competition.
Additionally, the intrinsic motivation to exercise is not high and is hard to sustain
over longer periods of time, and then the lack of personalization in the application
just makes the process of exercising more difficult. Therefore, through research
[7,8] and interviews with college students, we discovered that a lack of
personalization in current fitness tracking apps is a major factor that adds to a lack
of motivation. Additionally, a combination of the two: rewards in the form of
social media’s instant gratification, gamification rewards, or extrinsic/monetary
rewards, and a lack of personalization, lead to fake outs.

<h3 style="color:#ff5257;"> So, back to the loop. </h3>

Through primary and secondary research, we propose that we tackle motivation
through a high level of personalization (Appendix 1.5) - essentially making users
feel like the tracking application is made just for them. Moreover, with college
students, making sure their tracker understands and empathizes with their variable
studying schedule was vital.
We will also attempt to revamp the reward system so that it furthers the
overarching goal - to be healthier - rather than extrinsic rewards that misalign
motivation. We’re attempting to cut off the extrinsic reasons why our demographic
would fake out by keeping them stuck in the loop of continuing to use the app to get
rewards that further your goal to be healthier, that keep you using the app again.

<h3 style="color:#ff5257;"> The Personalization Paradox. </h3>

While personalization was a very common theme that we encountered during
interviews and research, we concluded that we needed to also cater to something
known as the personalization paradox [17]. It identifies two problems with high
personalized applications:

1.&nbsp;The self-reinforcing loop problem: When a personalization system “forces”
a user into following whatever it categorizes, regardless of accuracy.

2.&nbsp;The moving target problem: The model should adapt and grow with the user at their pace.

We also attempted to solve these two overarching problems with our solution.

<h2 style="font-size: 24px"> Solutions </h2>

<h3 style="color:#ff5257;"> The user is in the driving seat. </h3>

<div class="flex justify-between"> 
    <div style="width: 48%"> 
        
A solution to the self-reinforcing loop problem is to
always keep the user empowered to not only view the
information that has been learned about them but also
edit it as they wish. Therefore, the user’s profile screen
(fig 1.) has multiple edit options which help to enable or
disable the information about them that the application
can collect or use to provide a tailored experience for
them. Therefore, putting the users in total control
and providing a personalized as per their
requirements.

<h3 style="color:#ff5257;"> Rewards Revamp. </h3>

Rewards need to be aligned with fitness goals, they should eliminate extrinsic motivations to fake out
and rather loop the user back into using the tracker. Let’s discuss two scenarios:

1.&nbsp;Imagine you’re a college student who has just started a cardio exercise plan - that the tracking
application has fit right into your busy schedule. You’re nearly done with just the first exercise in
the lengthy plan. As soon as you’ve achieved your cycling distance goal, you are greeted with a
prompt that congratulates you for achieving your goal and also adds in a tailored congratulatory
message - for instance, a health fact that you have achieved based on your health data and
exercising goal. This informational message aims to motivate the users as a form of an
intrinsic reward.

2.&nbsp;Now imagine you have been working on your arms for a month now, using
your wearable device to collect all sorts of statistics for the application -
you’re nearly done with your plan. You open the last workout for the plan, and complete it using the video tutorial. You immediately get greeted with a
congratulatory message that informs you about a new in-app feature (that
aligns with your goal) that you have just unlocked - a nutrition plan in this
case.
This reward has a much higher weightage than the one in scenario one - it
scales according to your achievement. By unlocking a“premium”feature,
we aim to increase your motivation to further use the application. Hence,
the motivation-reward loop.

<h3 style="color:#ff5257;"> Fine-tuned to your schedule. </h3>

The application also suggests exercises specifically tailored for a user and fits the
exercises in their schedule. That ties in with the entire language of the application -
research suggested that this is essential for attempting to alter behavior patterns.

<div class="flex justify-between"> 
    <div style="width: 48%"> 
        
Our solution is to have a separate calendar feature that
lets you add in by yourself or export your lecture
schedule - and leave the rest to the application. It will
aim to provide you with tailored exercises that you can
fit into your schedule. And as always, tackling the
personalization paradox, you will always have the option
to adjust it anytime.
