<h2 class="sub-heading"> PROBLEM </h2>
<h3 style="color:#CF7000;"> Neglected entertainment. </h3>

People with visual impairment, particularly children and teenagers deserve an equal amount of access to digital entertainment as everybody else. Unfortunately, while there are promising digital interventions to assist the visually impaired with basic, routine tasks, the field of entertainment has been left neglected.

**Everyone deserves the opportunity to enjoy video games regardless of their disability**. Digital entermainment for the visually impaired is a vast, but complex design space that can enable this demographic to have experiences that they are unfortunately hindered from having in real life. For this project, we focused on the needs of the blind community specifically in a Pakistani context.

<h2 class="sub-heading"> IDEATING </h2>
<h3 style="color:#CF7000;">Embracing non-linearity.</h3>

While we had concrete stages in our design process, the path through them was fairly non-linear.

</div>

<h3 style="color:#CF7000;">Making new friends.</h3>

Secondary research provided us with a fairly good idea about how the blind and visually impaired commuinicate with technology. Literature reviews on existing accessible applications were also essential in understanding the problem space.

The next step for us was to **empathize** with our target users to understand how they went about their daily lives with their disability and the intricate ways with which they had adapted to modern technology.

My group and I decided to visit the _Kinnaird College for Women_ and the _Rising Sun Institute for Special Children_ in Lahore, Pakistan, to conduct **semi-structured interviews** in focus groups and to perform **contextual inquiry** on their usage of technology. The findings are consicely understood through two personas:

<img loading="lazy"  class="w-full" src="/info/works/blind-wheels/persona-1.svg" />
</div>
<div class="flex justify-center w-full">
<img loading="lazy"  class="w-full" src="/info/works/blind-wheels/persona-2.svg" />
</div>

<h3 style="color:#CF7000;">Putting pen to paper.</h3>

Now that we had some data to work with, the team decided to brainstorm to converge down to a set of features that would be guiding our design. Key insights included:

- Support for Urdu language
- Target real life experiences that are inaccessible otherwise
- Should be easy to play, difficult to master
- Striking a balance between verbosity and succintness with narration.

Using these as guiding factors, we sketched out some design alternatives, including a car racing, a zombie escape and music playing game:

<div class="flex flex-col justify-center w-full">
<img loading="lazy"  class="w-4/5" src="/info/works/blind-wheels/sketches.jpeg" />
<img loading="lazy"  class="w-4/5" src="/info/works/blind-wheels/sketches2.jpeg" />
</div>

Sketching let us know which genre of gaming fulfilled most of the insights we had noted from our contextual inquiry. Since our goal was to provide our users with an experience they are unable to get otherwise, we opted for the racing game alternative.

It targeted a longing for the blind - for most, it would be the first time they would have direct control over a virtual car.

<h2 class="sub-heading"> PROTOTYPING </h2>
<h3 style="color:#CF7000;">Staying Lo-Fi.</h3>

With a design that is focused heavily on audio and interaction, rather than visuals, we believed it was vital to test it out with a **paper prototype** before we moved to the final design.

<div class="flex flex-col justify-center w-full">
<img loading="lazy"  class="w-full" src="/info/works/blind-wheels/paper-prototype.png" />
</div>

Unfortunately, not all goes to plan so we could not conduct the testing with the visually impaired community due to logistical constraints.

Therefore we tested it with sighted individuals, who were asked to close their eyes and try to follow the instructions that were spoken to them by one of our team members. Once they were at the racing mode, they were given a headset where a member of the team controlled the car engine's audio to switch between left and right channels.

We found out that the participants were fairly succesful and responsive to the bi-directional sounds. This was a promising sign for us.

<h3 style="color:#CF7000;">Going Hi-Fi.</h3>

We used [Protopie](https://www.protopie.io/) for hi-fi prototyping, since it could prototype the interactions we were looking for.

<img loading="lazy" class="w-full" src="/info/works/blind-wheels/blind-wheels-hifi.svg" />
</div>

> A challenge for us was to find suitable software for prototyping the interactions that the blind have with their devices. For instance, through contextual inquiries, we noted how they double tap to select and single tap to activate voice-over.
> <br> <br>
> Moreover, they do not lift their finger from the screen as we're normally accustomed with - dragging across the screen is their main mode of navigation.

One member of the team provided the voice over for all the options on the screen. The script, as well as the delivery, was an extremely important part of the overall design since that was the primary mode of conveying information to the users. The flow is provided below:

</div>

<br>

<h2 class="sub-heading"> EVALUATION </h2>
<h3 style="color:#CF7000;">Wizard of Oz.</h3>

It was time for evaluating the design.

The prototype was tested with 9 participants. Once they reached the racing screen, a team member would **manually adjust the car engine's sound to either be tilted to the left, middle, or right channels**, alternating between them. They also controlled haptic feedback - so when the participants rotated their phone a wrong way, the phone's vibration was triggered.

We received favourable responses from the participants. Almost all of them (7/9) were able to navigate to racing mode without our intervention. It was interesting to note how the participants responsed much quicker to the alternating sounds than the sighted participants who had used our paper prototypes.

Another key finding was that the error rates were much higher for the children at the _Rising Sun Institutute_ (ages 10-14). A possible reason might have been that the children did not regularly use smartphones. Regardless, it meant that we had room for improvement in our design.

<br>

<h2 class="sub-heading"> REFLECTION </h2>
<h3 style="color:#CF7000;">Looking ahead.</h3>

While the evaluation results were favourable, we felt that to really make the blind community not feel otherized, our design should be one that is inclusive for everyone. What would truly have been remarkable would have been if there was a single game that those with sight and those without could play, without any indidivual having an advantage over the other.
