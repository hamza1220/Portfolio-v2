<h2 class="sub-heading"> BACKGROUND </h2>
<h3 style="color:#4fb400;"> Tipped scales. </h3>

The gig economy has enabled people to hire designers and developers for
projects with just a few clicks. However, issues such as clients rating
only extreme experiences, positively
skewed ratings, and the lack of information to enable a holistic hiring decision, makes the current rating systems flawed.

These flaws are more detrimental for the freelancer than they are for the client. **_The scales are tipped unfairly._**

The goals of this project therefore were to alter the ways freelancers are evaluated such that:

- The user journey of working with that freelancer is clear to potential customers;
- The freelancer receives a fair assessment of their work;
- The freelancer can use the feedback to improve over time;

> This project focuses on _Fiverr_ in particular, however, the solutions suggested are applicable to most freelance platforms.

<h2 class="sub-heading"> PROBLEMS </h2>

<h3 style="color:#4fb400;"> Your stars aren't my stars. </h3>

Each client has their own understandings of star ratings. A common behaviour is how _acceptable_ work is given five stars and the rest of the scale is reserved for anything less.

<div class="flex justify-between"> 
    <div style="width: 48%" class="flex flex-col justify-evenly">

This is what we described as a _“your stars aren’t my stars”_ phenomenon - each client tends to think of the stars-performance mapping differently. This understanding of rating scales has led to freelance platforms having positively skewed ratings. And if all ratings are positive, then its hard to seperate the good from the best.

<h3 style="color:#4fb400;"> Stars aren't enough. </h3>

Clients generally use a combination of an average star rating, the freelancer’s past
work, accompanied by reviews left by clients to make an informed hiring decision.

However, because of the "5 stars or fail" idea, clients end up extracting meaning from just a
numerical score. What really is the difference between a 4.9 vs a 4.7 rated freelancer?

It follows that the onus of maintaining a good rating is also
heavily dependent on the freelancer while the clients are generally nonchalant
about it.

<h3 style="color:#4fb400;"> Clients are busy bees. </h3>

Let's jump straight to the dillema: **people want to read reviews but people don't want to write reviews.**

Clients are too busy to write lengthy reviews, but detailed reviews are essential for a holistic hiring process.
There needs to be a balance between the effort that is being asked of clients to write reviews, and the availibility and conciseness of existing reviews on a freelancer.

<h2 class="sub-heading"> IDEATING </h2>

<h3 style="color:#4fb400;"> Sketching out. </h3>

The team and I decided to brainstorm ideas with sketches. It was important to constrain the sketches to the three broad problems identified above, but also provide room for wild ideas. Any idea we thought of, we would turn back to secondary research to understand its constraints and limitations. This was vital in developing a strong design rationale.

For instance, we initially converged on a sliding scale rather than star ratings, but iterating back to research revealed its limitations, which is why we ditched the idea.

<h2 class="sub-heading"> SOLUTIONS </h2>

Through the sketching process, we converged on the following ideas:

<h3 style="color:#4fb400;"> Word Cloud. </h3>

Research strongly suggested that written accounts of people for a service are extremely important to enhance the purchase decision making process. Paradoxically, our interviews with clients revealed how they are too short on time to read through all the reviews.

A word cloud therefore aims to provide an overview of a freelancer from just a cursory glance.

</div>

<br>

<h3 style="color:#4fb400;"> Stars, but with context. </h3>

People have their own understandings of stars. One might think a 4 is pretty decent, while someone else might not. Another may hand out 5's to everyone while someone else might be extremely selective with it.

These differences cause rating inflation and do not necessarily represent a client's actual process of working with that freelancer.

<img loading="lazy" class="w-full" src="/info/works/freelance-life/context-stars.svg" />
</div>

<h3 style="color:#4fb400;"> Less information, more feedback. </h3>

As a way to encourage clients to leave reviews more often, they can choose to describe their experience from a select list of diverse words.

This is particularly aimed at clients who do not wish to write lengthy reviews. It not only provides them with an easier alternative that has less cognitive load, but also acts as a dictionary that the word cloud can build on.

<br>
<h2 class="sub-heading"> EVALUATION </h2>

<h3 style="color:#4fb400;"> Future steps. </h3>

From my experience in the software industry, I believe A/B testing these concepts would yield fruitful results, which could drive future improvements. Since A/B testing requires a large sample size, it was not feasible given the scope of the project.

Regardless, A/B testing could potentially provide data that can be analyzed to understand whether people's ratings changed with the annotations. It can also reveal whether the word cloud has enabled lesser rated freelancer's to be hired more.

We also explored several sub-problem spaces within each concept as well, which was really interesting. That would unfortunately make this summary too lengthy. But feel free to shoot me an email and we can discuss!
