<h3 style="color:#4fb400;"> Tipped scales. </h3>

The gig economy has enabled people to hire designers and developers for
projects with just a few clicks. However, issues such as clients rating
only extreme experiences, positively
skewed ratings, and the lack of information to enable a holistic hiring decision, makes the current rating systems flawed.

These flaws are more detrimental for the freelancer than they are for the client. **_The scales are tipped unfairly._**

The goals of this project therefore were to alter the ways freelancers are evaluated such that:

- The user journey of working with that freelancer is clear to potential customers;
- The freelancer receives a fair assessment of their work;
- The freelancer can use the feedback to improve over time;

> This project focuses on _Fiverr_ in particular, however, the solutions suggested are applicable to most freelance platforms.
