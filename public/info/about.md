I'm currently a Master's student at <span class="font-semibold hover:opacity-75" style="color:#8E6F3E">Purdue University</span> studying UX Design. Most recently, I was a Design Engineering intern at <a href="https:www.onesignal.com" style="text-decoration:none "> <span class="cursor-pointer font-semibold hover:opacity-75" style="color:#e54b4d">OneSignal.</span> </a> Previously, I was a full-stack software engineer at <a href="https://www.educative.io" style="text-decoration:none"><span class="cursor-pointer font-semibold hover:opacity-75 gradient-purple text-gradient">Educative, Inc.</span></a> My interests revolve around UX Design, Product Management and Software Engineering.

As an engineer, I not only loved working as a technical design lead but also enjoyed engaging in the product and design discussions and enjoyed channeling my creativity there. This is why I am driven to complement my computer science background with a UX specialization.

I believe my engineering background is crucial for me to find my place as a product designer at the intersection of design and development, which is the lens I view my design philosophy by.

If you want to work with me, or want to grab coffee, or rant about how bad Manchester United are right now, send me an email over at raza.khawaja@hotmail.com.
