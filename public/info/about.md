I'm currently a student at <span class="font-semibold hover:opacity-75" style="color:#8E6F3E">Purdue</span> studying UX Design. Most recently, I was a full-stack software engineer at <a href="https://www.educative.io" style="text-decoration:none"><span class="cursor-pointer font-semibold hover:opacity-75 gradient-purple text-gradient">Educative Inc.</span></a> My interests revolve around Human-Computer Interaction, UX Design, and Software Engineering.

Through my experiences, I've found that the best product designers would be those who have knowledge of both, engineering and design. That is how I view my personal design philosophy by and it is what drives me forward to pursue UX on top of my computer science background.

If you want to work with me, or want to grab coffee, or rant about how bad Manchester United are right now, send me an email over at raza.khawaja@hotmail.com.
