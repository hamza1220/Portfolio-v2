I'm a Master's student at <span class="font-semibold hover:opacity-75" style="color:#8E6F3E">Purdue University</span> studying UX Design. I currently work as a UX Consultant and Research Assistant at Purdue's <a href="https://www.dvclab.net/" target="_blank">DVC Lab</a> for the <a href="https://sciencegateways.org/" target="_blank">Science Gateways Community Institute</a>. Previously, I was a Design Engineering intern at

My interests revolve around UX Design, Research and Product Management.

As an engineer, I not only loved working as a technical design lead but also enjoyed engaging in the product and design discussions and enjoyed channeling my creativity there. This is why I am driven to complement my computer science background with a UX specialization. This has allowed me to find my place as a designer at the intersection of design and development.
