            I feel like my eventual goal is to become a product manager that has
            experience in both domains - the technology end and the users end. I
            believe knowledge of both is to make sure engineering aligns with
            user experience - that is why I feel like a UX Design degree will
            complement my computer science background.

            But enough about work; I am a sports geek - my favourite sport is
            football, where I support Manchester United. I also enjoy watching
            Tennis, Cricket and occasionally MMA. Recently, I have found I like
            cooking as well! I am trying to start reading and writing again too,
            but I can't say I've been too successful yet. Oh, and I love
            animals!
