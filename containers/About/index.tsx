            As an engineer, I not only loved working as a technical design lead
            but also enjoyed engaging in the product and design discussions and
            enjoyed channeling my creativity there. This is why I am driven to

            I believe my engineering background is crucial for me to find my
            place as a product designer at the intersection of design and
            development, which is the lens I view my design philosophy by.
